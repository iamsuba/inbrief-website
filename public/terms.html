                  <p><strong>1. GENERAL</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>IOS</strong></p>
                  <p>These terms and conditions of use (“Terms”) along with privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) (hyperlinked) forms a 
                      legally binding agreement (“Agreement”) between You and Us (“InChain Corp.”, “InBrief”, “Our”, “We”).</p>
                  <p>Hence, We insist that You spend time reading these Terms and Privacy Policy and let Us 
                      know at contact@inbrief.app if You have any questions regarding the same. We will try 
                      our best to answer Your queries.</p>
                  <p>Since You downloaded Our App from AppStore, You will also be subject to AppStore Terms and Conditions. 
                      If there is any conflict between AppStore Terms and Conditions and this Agreement with respect to
                       Your use of the App, then, this Agreement shall prevail.</p>
                  <p><Strong>A. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION</Strong></p>
                  <p>1. Capitalized terms, not defined elsewhere in this Agreement, shall mean as follows:</p>

                      of AppStore platform and as available at https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstore/jm/terms.html></p>
                  <p>(d) “User” or “You” or “Your” refers to a natural person who has accepted this Agreement 
                      in order to download and use the App.</p>
                  <p>2. Any reference to the singular includes a reference to the plural and vice versa, and any reference 
                      to one gender includes a reference to other gender(s), unless explicitly provided for.</p>
                  <p>3. Headings and captions are used for convenience only and not for interpretation of the Agreement.</p>
                  <p>4. Any reference to a natural person shall, include his/her heirs, executors and permitted assignees and
                       any reference to a juristic person shall, include its affiliates, successors and permitted assignees, 
                       unless repugnant to the context.</p> 
                  <p><strong>B. YOUR APPROVAL</strong></p>
                  <p>1. You approve of and accept this Agreement by:</p>
                  <p>(a) downloading and/or installing the App on Your device; or</p>
                  <p>(b) accessing or using the App or any of the content available within the App from any device.</p>
                  <p>2. You can accept this Agreement only if:</p>
                  <p>(a) You are of the legal age, eligibility and mental capacity to form a binding contract with 
                      InBrief pursuant to Your use of the App; and</p>
                  <p>(b) You are not legally barred from using the App.</p>
                  <p>3. You understand that We want You to not use the App if You do not understand, approve of or
                       accept all the terms specified in this Agreement. Hence, You are requested to read these Terms 
                       and Privacy Policy (hyperlinked) carefully and understand the Agreement before You accept it 
                       and agree to be bound by it. </p>
                  <p><strong>C. PROVISION OF THE APP</strong></p>
                  <p>1. The App is designed to provide You an in-app browsing experience through 
                      an embedded browser. The App does not per se provide any news or content or 
                      information; but provides a brief summary of the content available in public
                      domain within 60 (sixty) words or less by aggregating such content within 
                      one platform for easy access by You and for assisting You to find corresponding 
                      content of Your interest. The App does not host, display or transmit any content 
                      owned by third parties on its servers, unless We either have a license or are 
                      not prohibited under the applicable law, to do the same. When You read a summary,
                      You may be linked to one of the online sources of such duly aggregated summary,
                      upon clicking “Read the Full Story in Detail at” Your screen. You agree and 
                      acknowledge that the App does not report and/or broadcast any content (including news)
                       on its own accord and InBrief is not responsible or liable for the content or
                      accuracy of the summary of content that may be accessed by You through the App.</p>
                  <p>2. The App may include links to other mobile applications and/or websites 
                      (some of which may be automated search results) which may contain materials 
                      that are objectionable, unlawful, or inaccurate. We do not endorse or support 
                      these links or the products and services they provide; these links are provided 
                      for Your convenience only. We are not responsible or liable for the content or accuracy of such links.</p>
                  <p>3. In order to provide the App to You, We may request You to register and/or provide information
                       about yourself. We trust that any information provided by You will always be true, accurate, 
                       complete and updated.</p>
                  <p>4. The content displayed on the App is for Your non-commercial and personal use. 
                      You are not allowed to copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works of,
                       or publicly display any content displayed on the App.</p>
                  <p>5. We may stop provision of the App (or any part of the App), permanently or temporarily,
                       to You or to Users generally or may modify or change the nature of the App and/or these 
                       Terms at Our sole discretion, without any prior notice to You. Your use of the App following 
                       any such modification constitutes Your deemed acceptance to be bound by the Agreement (or as it may be modified).</p>
                  <p><strong>D. YOUR AGREEMENT WITH INBRIEF</strong></p>
                  <p>1. A violation of this Agreement may result in a legal liability upon You and that nothing 
                      in this Agreement should be construed to confer any rights to any third party. 
                      You are responsible for Your conduct and activities while using the App, and for 
                      any consequences thereof.</p>
                  <p>2. If any provision of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable under the applicable law, 
                      it will not affect the enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any 
                      provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall 
                      be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent 
                      of the original provision and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.</p>
                  <p>3. We may choose to not act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by You or others but
                       this does not mean that We cannot act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Our 
                       intended or intended failure to exercise or enforce any provision of this Agreement shall 
                       not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. </p>
                  <p><strong>E. USING THE APP</strong></p>
                  <p>1. You will download and install the App from AppStore for using it. You will also download and 
                      update the relevant latest versions of the App and any relevant updates provided by Us to avail 
                      continued access to the App.</p>
                  <p>2. While the App is available to You free of cost, We may amend these Terms and impose a cost on 
                      the App or services provided through the App, in future, by giving You a prior notice in this regard.</p>
                  <p>3. You will use the App only for such purposes as is permitted by (a) this Agreement; and (b) any law, 
                      regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines applicable in the country of which You are 
                      a citizen, in which You are a resident or from where You use the App.</p>
                  <p>4. For Your use of the App, InBrief grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to 
                      install and use the App on Your IOS device. However, You shall not copy the App or any of its 
                      components, except for the purpose of making a single archival back up copy. </p>
                  <p>5. InBrief also grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access such content on 
                      the App which is owned by InBrief. For using any content owned by a third party, You still 
                      require a license from such third party, We don’t license such content to You and Your use 
                      of content owned by a third party is governed by applicable terms and conditions prescribed
                      by such third party.</p>
                  <p><strong>F. RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR USE</strong></p>
                  <p>1. You will not use the App or any content provided thereof for any purpose that is illegal,
                       unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement.</p>
                  <p>2. You will not access (or attempt to access) the content provided through the App by any 
                      means other than through the App, unless You have been specifically allowed to do so in a 
                      separate written agreement with InBrief. </p>
                  <p>3. You will not redistribute, sublicense, rent, publish, sell, assign, lease, market, 
                      transfer, or otherwise make the App or any component or content thereof, 
                      available to third parties.</p>
                  <p>4. You will not circumvent or disable any digital rights management, usage rules, or
                       other security features of App; remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary 
                       notices (including copyright notices) on any portion of the App; and not use 
                       the App in a manner that threatens the integrity, performance, or availability of the App.</p>
                  <p>5. You will not attempt to or engage in any activity that may:</p>
                  <p>(a) reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise extract the source code related to the App or 
                      any part thereof, unless it is expressly permitted by InBrief to You in writing or is
                       required by the applicable law;</p>
                  <p>(b) use any robot, spider, retrieval application, or other device to retrieve or index 
                      any portion of the App or content thereof;</p>
                  <p>(c) collect information about users of the App for any illegal or unlawful purpose;</p>
                  <p>(d) create any user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent pretences for using the App;</p>
                  <p>(e) transmit any viruses, worms, defects, trojan horses, or any items of a destructive nature through the App;</p>
                  <p>(f) use the App in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair, or undertake any action 
                      which is harmful or potentially harmful to, any of the servers, networks, computer systems or resources 
                      connected to any of the servers connected, directly or indirectly to the App, or interfere with any 
                      other third party's use and enjoyment of the App;</p>
                  <p>(g) carry out any denial of service (DoS, DDoS) or any other harmful attacks on the App or; 
                      disrupt or place unreasonable burdens or excessive loads on, or interfere with or attempt 
                      to make, or attempt any unauthorized access to the App or any part of the App or 
                      any user of the App;</p>
                  <p>(h) forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin
                       of any content transmitted through the App; or</p>
                  <p>(i) obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available,
                       in the opinion of InBrief, through the App.</p>
                  <p>6. You will not impersonate another person or impersonate, guide or host on behalf of, or 
                      falsely state or otherwise misrepresent Your affiliation with any person or entity,
                       including, but not limited to Our officials, employees, agents, partners, affiliates,
                        dealers and franchisees.</p>
                  <p><strong>G. TERMINATION</strong></p>
                  <p>1. Your access to the App may be terminated if:</p>
                  <p>(a) You voluntarily uninstall the App from Your device;</p>
                  <p>(b) You knowingly or unknowingly cause direct or indirect breach, as ascertained by InBrief, of these 
                      Terms or Privacy Policy as a whole or in part; or</p>
                  <p>(c) You do not pay the requisite fee, if any, should InBrief charge for use of the App.</p>
                  <p>2. We may have to terminate Your access to the App if:</p>
                  <p>(a) We are required to do so by law (for example, where the access to and/or provision 
                      of the App to You becomes, unlawful);</p>
                  <p>(b) The third party, if any, with whom We offered the App to You has terminated its relationship 
                      with Us or ceased to offer the related services to Us or to You;</p>
                  <p>(c) The provision of App to You, is no longer commercially viable or feasible for Us; or</p>
                  <p>(d) You are a repeat infringer of this Agreement.</p>
                  <p>3. We may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without notice and may procure disabling

                  <p>4. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by terminating Your access to the App. However, 
                      Your certain obligations under this Agreement shall continue to prevail even on such termination.</p>
                  <p>5. When this Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities 
                      that You and InBrief have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over 
                      time whilst the Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, 
                      shall be unaffected by this cessation, and shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations

                  <p><strong>C. PROVISION OF THE APP</strong></p>
                  <p>1. The App is designed to provide You an in-app browsing experience through an 
                      embedded browser. The App does not per se provide any news or content or 
                      information; but provides a brief summary of the content available in public 
                      domain within 60 (sixty) words or less by aggregating such content within one 
                      platform for easy access by You and for assisting You to find corresponding 
                      content of Your interest. The App does not host, display or transmit any 
                      content owned by third parties on its servers, unless We either have a license 
                      or are not prohibited under the applicable law, to do the same. When You read a 
                      summary, You may be linked to one of the online sources of such duly aggregated 
                      summary, upon tapping “Read the Full Story in Detail at” tab on Your screen. 
                      You agree and acknowledge that the App does not report and/or broadcast any 
                      content (including news) on its own accord and InBrief is not responsible or 
                      liable for the content or accuracy of the summary of content that may be 
                      accessed by You through the App.</p>
                  <p>2. The App may include links to other mobile applications and/or websites 
                      (some of which may be automated search results) which may contain materials 
                      that are objectionable, unlawful, or inaccurate. We do not endorse or 
                      support these links or the products and services they provide; these links 
                      are provided for Your convenience only. We are not responsible or liable 
                      for the content or accuracy of such links.</p>
                  <p>3. In order to provide the App to You, We may request You to register and/or 
                      provide information about yourself. We trust that any information provided 
                      by You will always be true, accurate, complete and updated.</p>
                  <p>4. The content displayed on the App is for Your non-commercial and personal use. 
                      You are not allowed to copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative 
                      works of, or publicly display any content displayed on the App.</p>
                  <p>5. We may stop provision of the App (or any part of the App), permanently or 
                      temporarily, to You or to Users generally or may modify or change the 
                      nature of the App and/or these Terms at Our sole discretion, without 
                      any prior notice to You. Your use of the App following any such modification 
                      constitutes Your deemed acceptance to be bound by the
                      Agreement (or as it may be modified).</p>
                  <p><strong>D. YOUR AGREEMENT WITH INBRIEF</strong></p>
                  <p>1. A violation of this Agreement may result in a legal liability 
                      upon You and that nothing in this Agreement should be construed 
                      to confer any rights to any third party. You are responsible for 
                      Your conduct and activities while using the App, and 
                      for any consequences thereof.</p>
                  <p>2. If any provision of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable 
                      under the applicable law, it will not affect the enforceability 
                      of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of 
                      this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision 
                      shall be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that 
                      most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the 
                      remaining provisions shall be enforced.</p>
                  <p>3. We may choose to not act with respect to a breach of this Agreement 
                      by You or others but this does not mean that We cannot act with respect 
                      to subsequent or similar breaches. Our intended or intended failure to 
                      exercise or enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute 
                      a waiver of such right or provision. </p>
                  <p><strong>E. USING THE APP</strong></p>
                  <p>1. You will download and install the App from Google Play for using it. 
                      You will also download and update the relevant latest versions of the 
                      App and any relevant updates provided by Us to avail continued access to the App.</p>
                  <p>2. While the App is available to You free of cost, We may amend these Terms and impose 
                      a cost on the App in future. We don’t promise to but will try our best to give You 
                      a prior notice in this regard.</p>
                  <p>3. You will use the App only for such purposes as is permitted by (a) this Agreement; 
                      and (b) any law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines applicable

                      You use the App.</p>
                  <p>4. For Your use of the App, InBrief grants You a limited, non-exclusive,

                  <p>5. InBrief also grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access 
                      such content on the App which is owned by InBrief. For using any content owned
                      by a third party, You still require a license from such third party, We don’t license 
                      such content to You and Your use of content owned by a third party is governed by 
                      applicable terms and conditions prescribed by such third party.</p>

                          the intellectual property.</p>
                      <p>5. Any intellectual property which is not specifically mentioned to be owned by InBrief
                           is owned by their respective owners and the owners have a right to take appropriate
                          actions against You for any violation, infringement or passing off.</p>
